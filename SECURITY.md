# Security policy

## Supported versions

flowpact is before 1.0: only the latest release (`flowpact` on npm, `rumankazi/flowpact@v0.8`, the newest minor line, for the GitHub Action)
receives fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities privately through
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/rumankazi/flowpact/security/advisories/new), not in a public
issue. Include the version, how flowpact was run (CLI, GitHub Action, plugins) and, if possible, a minimal repository or
workflow that reproduces it.

You can expect an acknowledgement within 3 working days and an assessment within 10. Fixes are released as soon as
they are ready; the advisory is published once a fixed release is available, crediting the reporter unless they prefer
otherwise.

## Scope

flowpact reads untrusted input: the workflow, action and contract files of the repository it analyzes. Relevant reports
include anything that lets that input:

- read or write files outside the repository, or inside `.git` (for example through symlinks);
- inject terminal escape sequences, GitHub workflow commands (`::…::`) or Markdown/HTML into flowpact's output, annotations
  or job summary;
- exhaust memory or CPU disproportionately (for example YAML alias expansion or matrix size);
- execute code. Plugins listed in the config are JavaScript and run by design; the GitHub Action skips them on
  `pull_request_target` and `workflow_run` unless `plugins: true` is set. Ways around that are in scope.

## Verifying releases

Releases are published from GitHub Actions only:

- the npm package has npm provenance (`npm audit signatures`);
- each GitHub release carries the npm tarball with a Sigstore bundle (`.sigstore.json`) and its in-toto provenance
  (`.intoto.jsonl`): `gh attestation verify flowpact-<version>.tgz --repo rumankazi/flowpact`;
- from 0.8.3, the release also carries the GitHub Action as an archive (`flowpact-action-<version>.tar.gz`) and a
  CycloneDX SBOM for each artifact, all signed the same way, and is published only once every asset is attached;
- release tags (`v*`) can only be created or moved by the release automation and maintainers.

The [security page](https://rumankazi.github.io/flowpact/docs/security) describes what flowpact reads, writes and
sends, the permissions it needs, and how to verify each artifact.
