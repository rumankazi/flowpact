# flowpact (`flowpact`)

**Data-flow linter for GitHub Actions:** find the inputs, secrets and matrix values that arrive empty while the run
stays green.

GitHub Actions evaluates a missing matrix key, an undeclared secret or an optional input without a default to an empty
value: no error, no warning, a green run. When workflows call reusable workflows and local actions, that is how a test variant
or an upload stops running without anyone noticing. flowpact follows every input, secret, env var, matrix key and
output across those calls, evaluates every combination of the matrices written in your workflows, and reports where a
value goes missing. Use it next to actionlint, which checks each file in depth.

```sh
npx flowpact lint                         # lint .github/workflows and local actions
npx flowpact trace pipeline.yml:config    # where does this input go? (--up: where does it come from?)
npx flowpact explain FP401               # why it matters, how to fix it
npx flowpact generate                     # lock the interfaces in .github/flowpact/
npx flowpact check                        # lint + compare with the locked contracts
```

## Install

```sh
npm install --global flowpact     # then: flowpact lint
npm install --save-dev flowpact   # per project: npx flowpact lint
```

Requires Node.js 22 or newer. Exit codes: `0` clean, `1` findings at or above `--fail-on`, `2` usage or
configuration error, `3` internal error.

In GitHub Actions, use the action instead: `uses: rumankazi/flowpact@v0.8` (job summary, annotations, SARIF and a
downloadable patch when contracts drift).
